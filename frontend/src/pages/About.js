                This is my personal blog, dedicated to my late father Brent Richey. 
                I've used the domain name my dad left me that was supposed to be 
                our shared blog. My dad always spoke about writing, and I believe 
                he may have had a personal blog somewhere but I don't think he kept
                up with it too much. He was probably too busy with my sisters and I. 
                I'll be writing about a lot of different subjects, mostly as an 
                exercise in developing/communicating my ideas as well as forcing 
                myself to dive deeper into subjects I'm interested in. I hope that
                through this blog, I can share my ideas and honor my dad's legacy.
